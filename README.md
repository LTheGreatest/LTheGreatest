## Hi there, I'm Lucas ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a student at FEUP, Portugal:

* :mortar_board: I'm on the third year of the bachelor in Informatics and Computer Engineering.

* :zap: Because technology is my passion, I use my free time to explore and learn new skills and technologies.

* :muscle: I like to solve problems and possibly help other people in the process.
